			Nature can bring a lot of beauty into our lives.  Nature has a way of affecting our moods and it can force us to change our plans.  Nature is responsible for the sun, clouds, rain, and snow.  When it is sunny and bright outside, we feel cheerful inside.  When it is cloudy and rainy, we often feel gloomy.  When there is a beautiful and starry night, the moonlight makes us feel romantic.

			The inhabitants of the cities suppose that the country landscape is pleasant only half the yearâ€¦.To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and which shall never be seen again.

		In every living thing we see
       There must a great Creator be.
       The tree that grows from out the sod
       Points aloft to nature' God;
       The mighty ocean lone and wild
       Reveals a God to ocean's child;
       The lofty hills echoing call
       There is a God that made us all.
